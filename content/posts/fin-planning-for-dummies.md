description: "My first task was related to pagination of the data to be displayed on a listing page of a web app. The system has thousands of products, and currently we were displaying the item codes according to the number of product instead of actual number of item codes. In this post I will be going to talk about the concepts of Java Spring that I came around to complete this task.

Most of us live on our parents money before getting into full time job. Some fortunate ones start to earn even during studying but we all know that money is not spent on the daily needs.  

## Why do we need Financial planning
"Only money attracts money" - Scam 1992

#### Inflation
Money parked in your bank account is rusting daily. You can not beat inflation by keeping your money safely in your bank account. Money is not like a Parle-G biscuit whose value will remain same for than 20 years (how did they do it though?). Money is more like maggi which in last 10 years has decreased the weight and also increased the price.  
Currently India has an inflation rate of aroung 6%. The interest rate of salary account is 3%. Do you understand what that means?? Now I dont want to go into the [Power of compounding](https://medium.com/swlh/the-power-of-compound-interest-850ab4517506), but let me give you some numbers.  
Assume you were able to save as little as Rs.10K, and it is just staying in your account. Now in 5 years,
    - the value of Rs. 10K will be Rs 13K. i.e. 10K in 2020 is worth 13K in 2025. In simple words you will lose Rs. 3K in 5 years.
    - with an interest rate of 3% p.a., you will get around Rs. 11.5K.
That means you are loosing about Rs. 1.5K every 5 years by simply parking money in your account.  

#### Emergency
Another thing is "emergency". Now emergencies can be different types it can be medical emergency, or maybe you are not in job for some months or any situation where you need large sum immediately. In that case you should have some liquid fund ready by your side. Credit cards do come handy in situations like these though.

Apart from this what I personally believe is that we should let the money do the work and understand that the earlier you start the better it is.

As beginners we dont need to understand the whole economy of a country, its enough to know where money can be spent on things other than buying the stuff that you will get bored with later on. Knowing the common ways of investment will be enough.  

Need less to say you need to understand your expenditures and how much you can save at the end of month. Expenditure includes:  
    - monthly rent, electricity, water
    - ration
    - cooking and cleaning
    - daily commute (petrol and service if you own vehicle)
    - mobile recharge and wifi
    - new mobile 
    - clothes
    - eating out
    - travel
Some expenditures are  non recurring like buying mobile, laptop, headphones, other devices or their unexpected service, clothes, travel etc. You need to save money seperately for these every month. Say if you want to buy new Samsung M31 for Rs. 20K, if you save Rs. 4K every month it will take about 5 months to buy it. You can make a seperate fund for these non recurring expenditures.  

Being aware of your expenditures will help in taking the right decision about how much you can invest every month and can give you a better picture of your expectations.

## Insurance and Investment, keep them seperate  
#### Insurance  
##### Term Life Insurance
When my father asked to first get a life insurance I was shocked. I said that i am going to live long enough and the money that i will pay for the insurance will be of no good after that. But after talking to some people and researching about it on my own I realised the worth. JK, I realised the importnace only when I realised that they are dirt cheap for their worth. Like, a person of age 21 has to pay total premium of less than Rs. 4Lac to get a Rs. 1Cr cover. Doesnt it sounds awesome. And this amount turns out to be less than Rs. 1000 per month which doesnt sound too much.

The thing is that we only realise the importance of term insurance when some mishap happens to someone we know, and all their liablities gets transfered to their dependents. Its better to be prepared for these situations.

##### Health Insurance
I do believe that by now you should be aware of the huge bills that hospitals charge. Although most of the company covers their health insurance but there is generally no choice on the type of health insurance you can get. You have have to take what is being given. I love having choices, it gives me a sense of importance. Or there can also be the case of when you are not in a job. So its better to have a health insurance too.

The best thing is that these insurance are covered under tax saving 80C scheme. You are anyways paying tax why not invest that amount in the insurance instead?

#### Investments  
Once the insurance is done and considered in your monthly expenses. Now whatever money you save, can be sent for investments even as little as Rs. 100 can be invested under right scheme. 

##### SIP
Now comes the part "Paisa hi Paisa ko kheechta hai". 
Let me first explain you why do i love this quote so much. Imagine you have about Rs. 2Cr sum to invest. You invest it all in a stock for Rs. 2/share. God blesses you, and the stock price rises to Rs. 4/share in 15 days. You sell it all and get Rs. 4Cr. What was your role in here? All you did was choose the right stock. 
But another person invested Rs. 10K in the same stock. Total money after 15 days Rs. 20K.
Now as salaried employee we come under the second case. We get constant stream of cash on monthly basis, we dont have a large sum at one time. We can only invest small amounts, but we can do it in monthly basis. 

SIP(Systematic Investment Plan) allows us to do just that. We give our money to these people and they take care of investing in the right stock for us, which is what is known as Mutual Funds. 

**How to choose the right MF?** You can check the past performances of the fund any aggregator websites but i dont think thats a good measure of how the fund will perform in the future. What you can do is check the companies that the fund is investing in and why. If you think it is good enough then you can buy it, but that will take more time. I honestly dont know how to chose the right one. For the first timers you can start with a little amount and invest on your broker or relatives advices. 

For tax savings search for ELSS SIP. Investing under these funds come under 80C scheme.  

##### FDs
Fixed deposits used to be the favorite options for investment especially for our parents. Currently we can get interest rates of 5% for 2-5 yrs of investment. Which is BAD. This thing does not beat inflation and if you want the money before maturity you need to break the FD and start again, which stops the power of compounding. But i wouldnt be wasting your time to rant about FDs if they were not of any use.
