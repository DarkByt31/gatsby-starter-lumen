### Investments  
Once the insurance is done and considered in your monthly expenses. Now whatever money you save, can be sent for investments even as little as Rs. 100 can be invested under right scheme. 

#### SIP
Now comes the part "Paisa hi Paisa ko kheechta hai". 
Let me first explain you why do i love this quote so much. Imagine you have about Rs. 2Cr sum to invest. You invest it all in a stock for Rs. 2/share. God blesses you, and the stock price rises to Rs. 4/share in 15 days. You sell it all and get Rs. 4Cr. What was your role in here? All you did was choose the right stock. 
But another person invested Rs. 10K in the same stock. Total money after 15 days Rs. 20K.
Now as salaried employee we come under the second case. We get constant stream of cash on monthly basis, we dont have a large sum at one time. We can only invest small amounts, but we can do it in monthly basis. 

SIP(Systematic Investment Plan) allows us to do just that. We give our money to these people and they take care of investing in the right stock for us, which is what is known as Mutual Funds. 

**How to choose the right MF?** You can check the past performances of the fund any aggregator websites but i dont think thats a good measure of how the fund will perform in the future. What you can do is check the companies that the fund is investing in and why. If you think it is good enough then you can buy it, but that will take more time. I honestly dont know how to chose the right one. For the first timers you can start with a little amount and invest on your broker or relatives advices. 

For tax savings search for ELSS SIP. Investing under these funds come under 80C scheme.  

#### FDs
Fixed deposits used to be the favorite options for investment especially for our parents. Currently we can get interest rates of 5% for 2-5 yrs of investment. Which is BAD. This thing does not beat inflation and if you want the money before maturity you need to break the FD and start again, which stops the power of compounding. But i wouldnt be wasting your time to rant about FDs if they were not of any use.
