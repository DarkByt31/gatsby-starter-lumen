Most of us live on our parents money before getting into full time job. So the only thing we learn is that the money does not grow on tree. For most of us we never had the opportunity to be dependent only on ourselves financially. Damn, I miss those days when we were small and relatives used to give us money which were enough to buy momos every day for a week. Anyways lets get started.  

**NOTE**: Taking random advice from a random internet guy is injurious to health. Information on this site might turn out to be wrong in the near future. The idea of this post is NOT to give you any tips but to **introduce** you to the financial terms and the options that beginners have, for investment.

## Why do we need Financial planning
> "Only money attracts money" - Scam 1992

#### Inflation
Money parked in your bank account is rusting daily. You can not beat inflation by keeping your money safely in your bank account. The value of Parle-G biscuit has not changed since last 20 years, even the weight of the packet remains almost same. But unlike Parle-G, money is more like maggi, which in the last 10 years has increased the price(to Rs.12) and also decreased the weight(to 70g).  
Currently India has an inflation rate of around 6%. The interest rate of salary account is 3%. Did you get what that means?? I dont want to go into the [power of compounding](https://medium.com/swlh/the-power-of-compound-interest-850ab4517506), but let me give you some numbers.  
  
Assume you were able to save as little as Rs.10K, and it is just staying in your account. Now in 5 years,
  - the value of Rs. 10K will be Rs 13K. i.e. 10K in 2020 is worth 13K in 2025. In simple words you will lose Rs. 3K in 5 years.  
  - with an interest rate of 3% p.a., you will get around Rs. 11.5K.  
      
That means you are **loosing** about Rs. 1.5K every 5 years by simply parking money in your account.  
Commonly for consumable products, companies gradually decreases the *net weight* of their product to keep the prices same. This prevents the consumer to see the inflation around them.

#### Emergency
Another thing is "emergency". Now emergencies can be of different types it can be medical emergency, or maybe you are not in job for some months or any other situation where you need large sum immediately. In these cases you should have some funds ready by your side, which you can be taken out easily. On a side note **Credit cards** do come handy in situations like these.  

#### Financial goals
Some people can have financial goals like early retirement, financial independence, business, marriage, children education etc. These financial goals are achievable just like how IIT seat was achievable for us engineers :[. If you are looking for some solid financial goals like early retirement I recommend going through [r/FIRE](https://www.reddit.com/r/FIREIndia/wiki/index) and [r/IndiaInvestments](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/wiki/index). Hey I am a simple guy who is more concerned about making most of what he has already. As I am living with parents during lockdown this saves some bucks and its better to get it invested.  

--------------
Apart from this what I personally believe is that the earlier you start the better it is and this also allows the money to do the work of earning more money.

As beginners we dont need to understand the whole economy of a country, its enough to know where money can be kept/used other than your salary or savings account. Knowing the common ways of investment should be enough to get started with.  

Needless to say you need to understand your expenditures and how much you can save at the end of month. You can categorize your expenditures on the basis of:  
  - monthly rent including electricity and water
  - ration
  - cooking and cleaning
  - daily commute (petrol and service if you own vehicle)
  - mobile recharge and wifi
  - new mobile 
  - clothes
  - eating out
  - travel

Some expenditures are  non recurring like buying mobile, laptop, headphones, their unexpected services, clothes, travel etc. You need to consider that you are spending/saving some money every month for these expenses. Say if you want to buy new Samsung M31 for Rs. 20K, if you save Rs. 4K every month it will take about 5 months to buy it. You can make a seperate fund for these non recurring expenditures. It is good thing to bring down your expenditures to **monthly basis** for beginners which can help you to decide whether you can afford to have an SIP along with your Netflix subscription or just the netflix subscription this time.  
  
Being aware of your own expenditures will help in taking the right decision about how much you can invest every month and it can give you a better picture of your expectations.

## Insurance and Investment, keep them seperate
### Insurance  
#### 1. Term Life Insurance
When my father asked me to first get a life insurance I was didnt understand the worth. I said that I am going to live long enough and the money that I will pay for the insurance will be of no good after that. But after talking to some people and researching about it I realised the importance. JK, I realised the importnace only when I realised that they are **dirt cheap** for their worth. Like, a person of age 21 has to pay total premium of less than Rs. 4Lac to get a Rs. 1Cr cover. Doesnt it sounds awesome. And this amount turns out to be less than Rs. 1000 per month which doesnt sound too much.

The thing is that we only realise the importance of term insurance when some mishap happens to someone we know, and all their liablities gets transfered to their dependents. Moreover, as we grow old the the cost of premiums increases every year. So its better to start as early as possible. Another benefit of this is tax saving which I will be covering on later.  

There are 2 options for buying an insurance online or offline. Mostly the online options are cheaper. Counterparts of almost all the offline insurance can be found online at a cheaper rate. You can buy them either directly from their website or use an aggregator site such as [policybazar.com](policybazar.com) (because "mehenga nahi hai").  
If your family/relatives buys investments from a single broker, then you can go for offline option too. Otherwise the paperwork can be tedious for you depending on from whom you buy it. Buying from offline sources has the benfit of easy settlements. If you buy it online from an aggregator site then its the responsibility of the website you buy it from and not of the financial institute to settle the claims.  
  
Another thing is that you can also select the insurance which does not have any physical medical tests. You can filter these policies online. This will help in getting insurance early and easily without much of a hassle.

#### 2. Health Insurance
I do believe that by now you should be aware of the huge bills that hospitals charge. Although most of the company covers their health insurance but there is generally no choice on the type of health insurance you can get. You have have to take what is being given. I love having choices, it gives me a sense of importance. Or there can also be a case where you are not in a job and thus have no insurance. So its better to have a health insurance too.
  
There are a lot of different things to consider for health insurance like room rent limit, disease sub limits, co-payments, etc. Generally there are top up also available if you want to add a member or you want to add payment for particular disease. You can read more about it here: [Health Insurance 101](https://joinditto.in/health-insurance/articles/when-should-you-opt-for-opd/).
  
The best thing is that these insurance are covered under tax saving 80C scheme. You are anyways paying tax why not invest that amount in the insurance instead?
  
In the next post we will go through the investments that you can make. Tell me who does not want to double their money.
